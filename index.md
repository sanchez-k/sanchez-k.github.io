### CPSC 120

* Lab 2

    Lab 2, part 2 was one of my favorites because I always liked playing madlib games. I enjoyed being able to input a different answer in the terminal each time I ran the program. This lab taught me how to ask for a user’s input and how to display their input onto the terminal, which helped to create the madlib.


* Lab 6

    Lab 6, part 1 was another favorite lab of mine because it was a sandwich order madlib. I liked being able to get the user’s input through a vector and validating whether or not it had the right amount of command line arguments. I learned how to create a program that gets its input through the shell command using a vector instead of cin.


* Lab 9

    Lab 9, part 2 was my third favorite lab because I thought the philosopher's problem was interesting. I enjoyed creating a for-loop to see if both of the philosophers’ schedules were valid or not. In this lab, I learned how to check whether both strings had “e” at the same index.
